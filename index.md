Welcome to my website!

I am an avid learner and always find interest in new challenges. I am deeply fascinated by CFD, Aerodynamics, FSI, and Physics-based Machine Learning. As a mechanical engineering student, I am exploring the potential of artificial intelligence in the field of engineering design.
