### Cluster analysis of sequential behavior
- Conducted system design experiment and collect user behavioral data through a CAD system. Extract, manipulate and clean data for statistical analysis.
- Developed a novel method of identifying sequential behavior by implementing Markov Model and different clustering algorithms including K-means, Hierarchical Agglomerative, and Network-based approach.
- Using the clusters of designers, identified beneficial design patterns.

### Predicting design sequence
- Implemented deep learning models such as Feed-forward neural network (FNN), Recurrent neural network (RNN) (especially long short term memory unit/LSTM) in order to predict usersâ€™ future actions.
- Compare the deep learning models with the benchmark models (Random model and Repetitive model) and traditional sequential models such as Markov model and Hidden Markov model.
- Developed a deep learning framework for combining time-independent data and time-dependent data to improve the prediction accuracy.
